            Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded
            by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon 
            forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. 
            This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason 
            behind the name Ice-land!
