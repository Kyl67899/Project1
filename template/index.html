            <p class="text-below-title"><em>Iceland</em> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. When dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. 
                A country where insular existence has spurred a rish and vibrant culture.</p>

                    The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, 
                    and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, 
                    Iceleand is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. <br>
                    The Aurora Borealis, more commonly refferred to as the Northern Lights is a natural 
                    phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the 
                    Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks
                    across the skies.

                Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily give Icelandic director Elfar Aoalsteinsson great reviews
            </h3>
            <p class="p">
                nd of Sentence, by director Elfar Aoalsteins, receives very positive reviews in leading film 
                industry magazines such as Hollywood. The film's two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, 
                are also praised in both reviews. Hawkes has quite a few films under his belt and was nominated for 
                an Oscar for Winter's Bones and young Lerman is best known for his role in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
                Icelandic actor Olafur Darri Olafsson also has a small part in End of Sentence.
