        <h1 class="center">Iceland</h1>
        <p><em>Iceland</em> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. When dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. 
            A country where insular existence has spurred a rish and vibrant culture.</p>

                The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, 
                and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, 
                Iceleand is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
                The Aurora Borealis, more commonly refferred to as the Northern Lights is a natural 
                phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the 
                Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks
                across the skies

                When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
                namesake - namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. ice climbing on the glaciers is 
                practiced year-round and take place mainly on the Solheimajokull and svinafellsjokull 
                glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
